An application made for event organizing, handling, and management in Lebanon.

# How does it work?

It uses dart and flutter as a client-side mobile application. What you're seeing right now is exactly that.
It's made using android studio and my android 8 huawei phone, though I also have an android 15 emulator installed.
To be completely honest, it isn't the most ideal testing apparatus, but it's mobile and can be shown to people so that's
why I use it.

Anyways, in the app comes 2 main data models. The event and the user. Obviously, these are two classes that represent the
two main interactors in the app. The event has a TON of information about various kinds of events, and the users, well, are 
users. A person can log into this app as any user provided they have the correct credentials.
